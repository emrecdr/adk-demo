"""Build the throwaway repository every phase from 2 onward reviews.

A clean `main`, and a `feature/payments` branch that changes four files, three of them new, each carrying one
obvious defect: a `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)`, a hard-coded AWS key pair (Amazon's own documented example
values, so nothing real is here), a function nothing tests, and a copy-pasted block. What code finds is found every
run: the key pair, and in phase 7 ruff's shell call and the money rule inside the copied block. A lane found the
shell call in all seven live runs on Copilot; the untested function and the copy itself are the
lanes' to notice: a lane named the function in three runs of seven and the copy in none, and in five
of five once the tests lane was asked what a change leaves untested; `scripts/measure.py` measures it again. No network,
rehearsable — a golden repository in one script. Idempotent: the target is removed and rebuilt.

    uv run python scripts/make_demo_repo.py            # into the platform temp dir (see the printed path)
    uv run python scripts/make_demo_repo.py --fix      # the rehearsal: both blockers fixed

`--fix` is the talk's fix-and-rerun moment: it commits a receipt that is
plain text (printing is the caller's job, so no process is spawned at all) and
a config that reads its keys from the environment, so the same review command
moves from exit 1 to exit 0.
