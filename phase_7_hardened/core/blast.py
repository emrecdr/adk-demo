"""Blast radius: what at the head commit depends on each changed file, read from the syntax tree.

Review depth should follow blast radius. A change to a module half the tree
imports reaches all of it; a change nothing imports reaches nothing. So the
lanes are told, per file, what depends on it, and the report opens with the
same list, widest first, for the person deciding where to read closely. The
verdict never reads it: severity decides, as before.

Counted by code, from Python's own parser. `ast.parse` reads a module; it
never runs one, and running the reviewed code is the one thing this reviewer
never does. An import is resolved the way the tree spells it:

- a relative import (`from .charge import Charge`) by the importing file's own
  folder, exactly;
- an absolute one (`from payments.charge import charge`) by the last parts of
  a file's path, so a `src/` layout resolves without knowing the path Python
  would search, and only where the folder above those parts is a root:
  Python imports a short name from a root, and neither a folder holding
  `__init__.py` nor any folder inside one is a root, so `from types import`
  lands on no `gates/types.py`, and `import openai` on no `llms/openai.py`
  in a package's folder that lacks an `__init__.py` of its own. The one
  exception is the importing file's own folder, a script's or pytest's root
  for its own files, when that is no package. A name the standard library
  holds (`typing`, `email.utils`) lands only on a file at the top: through a
  root or that folder, it was nearly always the standard library's import,
  so a script's rare shadow of one goes uncounted. Any other name two files
  could answer counts for both: the radius errs wide there, never narrow;
- and either way an import depends on the module it names and on every
  package on the way to it, because Python runs each package's `__init__.py`
  first: `from pkg.x import y` reaches `pkg/__init__.py` as well as `pkg/x.py`,
  and `from pkg import name` reaches `pkg/name.py` when there is one.

Checked against an exact resolver built on `importlib`, over a 164-file tool
with one import root: no import missed, and every edge the exact one lacked
was real, a test importing `conftest.py` from pytest's own root. Hostile
input is refused, never run: a megabyte of nested brackets, a null byte and
200 levels of indentation each came back unparsed within a millisecond.

What depends on a file counts whether it imports the file itself or imports
something that does; the files named are those that import it themselves,
the call sites a change meets, and they decide what is widest. Measured over
30 installed packages: in 23, most files reach over half the tree through
other files, one of two counts shared by nearly all, so a count of all
alone told the files apart by name; the median file has 1 to 4 importers of
its own. Tests are counted apart from modules: a test that
imports a file is coverage, not exposure. What was not read is never read as
nothing: a file that is not Python is not measured, and when the parser
refused a file, the collector skipped one or the tree could not be listed at
all, a count of zero says the tree was not read whole rather than calling the
file a leaf.
