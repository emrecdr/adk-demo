"""What a review is, as types the code can read — and the scale a severity sits on.

`evidence` is a required field: a finding that cannot point at the diff is
worth nothing, so the model cannot omit it. `output_schema` on a lane turns
`Review` into the response schema the provider is asked for, and ADK puts the
parsed dict — not text — into session state.
