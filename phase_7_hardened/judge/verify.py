"""A second opinion: another model judges each finding a lane made — a second graph, run like the first.

A lane's finding is an opinion. `--verify` asks a second agent — with its own
model, so a stricter or a cheaper one, through `REVIEW_VERIFIER_MODEL` —
whether the quoted lines really show the problem. A refuted finding is
dropped and named, never silently; a finding the verifier could not judge
stays, and the reason is named too. The gates' findings are facts and are not
asked about. One verifier per finding, fanned out the way the lanes are — a
`Workflow` under the same `max_concurrency` — under the same plugin instances:
redaction, the ledger and its ceiling, a provider error as that verifier's own
answer. Each reads the whole diff, not its finding's file: a lane judged with
everything in view is judged with the same, and less would refute for what it
could not see.
