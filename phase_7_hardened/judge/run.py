"""One seeded run through ADK's engine, guarded: what the lanes' graph and the verifiers' share.

A session is created with the state the agents' instructions read, one user
message starts the run, every event is drained, and the state is read back
whatever happened. An agent that failed ends with an error event under its
own name — the plugins see to that — and its output unwritten; anything that
still escapes the engine is caught here and returned as the run's failure, so
what finished is still in the state and what failed is named, never a
traceback and Python's exit 1, which is the command's code for "findings
found".
